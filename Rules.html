    <h1>Rules</h1>
   <p>The wikipedia game doesn't have any rules that are set in stone, however there are some optional<br>
     rules. </p>
     <h2>Optional Rules</h2>
     <h3>CTRL + F</h3>
    <p>CTRL + F is generally unallowed in the wikipedia game, especially if you are<br>
         racing against somebody. If you would like to use this shortcut, make sure <br>
         the person you are racing against knows that they are allowed to use it aswell.
    </p>
    <h3>Previous Page</h3>
    <p>People also may or may not be able to go back to a previous page, and often going back to the<br>
    previous page can count as a click.</p>
