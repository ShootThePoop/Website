    <h1> Variations</h1>
    <h3>Random Article to Jesus</h3>
    <p>In random article to Jesus, you need to start from a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" target="_blank">Random Article</a>
    and make your way to the <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank">Jesus</a> 
    article in five clicks. </p>
        <h3>Random Article to Random Article</h3>
        <p>In Random article to random article, you start from a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" target="_blank">Random Article</a>
        and navigate your way to <br>another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" 
        target="_blank">Random Article</a>
        </p>
        <h3> Wikipedia Maze</h3>
        <p>
            In the wikipedia maze, you need to go from one article to another, but during your trip, <br>
            you need to go via other different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" 
            target="_blank">Random Articles</a>, you can go through as many different other sites as you'd like
            . In this variation, I would recommend using CTRL + F to search for things across websites to prevent
             the game lasting hours.<br>
            You also may want to only use articles to do with things that you are familiar with to decrease the 
            difficulty.
